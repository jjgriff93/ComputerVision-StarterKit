# ComputerVision-StarterKit
Some sample C# code built on top of the Microsoft samples for using the Computer Vision API to analyse images

## Getting started
Head to the /ComputerVision directory and open the .sln solution file, then set up one of the projects as the startup file and run. You can modify the URLs of the files to analyse accordingly in the code.
